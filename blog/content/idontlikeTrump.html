        "I don't like Donal Trump." said an American.
    </h1>

    <p>
        During a street interview, I spoke with an American who expressed his dislike for Donald Trump. He mentioned how many people are divided in their opinions about Trump. Personally, I have a deep skepticism towards politicians in general. It often seems like their primary concern is holding onto their positions and the benefits that come with them, rather than addressing the pressing issues facing the nation.

        Significant problems like mass shootings in schools, the abuse of minors, and various street-level crimes continue to plague communities across America. These issues underscore why many, including the person I interviewed, feel disillusioned with political figures like Trump. It seems that their focus is misplaced, and they fail to see the real struggles that everyday people face.
