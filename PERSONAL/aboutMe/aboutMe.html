    <div id="aboutMe">
        <p>Hello! I’m <b>Nhyoochan Rajkarnikar</b>, and I’m really excited to learn new things. I love photography, video editing, and a bit of graphic animation, but my main focus is video production. Over the years, I’ve created a lot of videos, and through that process, I’ve picked up many skills and insights. However, I’ve recently run into some challenges with my video editing skills. Because of this, I’m here to learn web development, which will help me build my own website. I’ve always been curious, which is one of the reasons I chose to work in the creative industry. I know a little about many topics, but I sometimes jump into learning without fully understanding everything, so there’s still a lot more for me to grasp.</p>
        <p>I’m quite good at video editing, especially since I get paid for it, which encourages me to dive deeper into that area. Right now, I’m also studying for my BCA, and this is another reason I’m learning web development. I believe that learning new skills can open up many opportunities in the future. While my path may change over time, my current focus is on living a happy life and gathering knowledge in different areas. I’m looking forward to what’s ahead and excited to keep learning and growing in my journey.</p>
